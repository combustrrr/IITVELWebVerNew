        <h1>Welcome to the World of Electromagnetics</h1>
        <p>
            Electromagnetic Field (EM) Theory is one of the fundamental courses for both Electrical and Electronics Engineering disciplines. 
            Generally, students perceive it as a difficult course to understand and they feel that the course is abstract and too mathematical. 
            It is essential to explain the involved theory in the course through real-life practical examples and visual aids.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this virtual EM laboratory, the concepts of vector calculus and underlying theories in electrostatics, magnetostatics, and 
            time-varying electromagnetic fields are explained using field plots generated by formulae and Finite Element Method (FEM) based computations.
